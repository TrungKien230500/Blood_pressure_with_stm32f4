# Blood-Pressure-and-Heart-Rate-Monitor-STM32F4

Read and calculate blood pressure and heart rate through the use of an STM32 microcontroller and I2C pressure sensor. Setting up the materials and tools listed in the repository, pressure data can be read from using a manual inflatable blood pressure cuff in C++. From there, the data can be placed into the Jupyter Notebook Python code that's also proovided for processing and calculating the systolic pressure, diatolic pressure and heart rate.
